# matplotlib-challenge

# I worked mostly by myself on this assignment. I did look at Aaron Otto's code since he shared it with me
# but I didn't really use it in any way.

# I looked up various syntax information, but I would say the main piece of code that I partially copied
# was the flier prop piece in cell 15 line 2. I took that part of the code from:

# https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/statistics/boxplot.html
# under the "demonstrate how to customize the display different elements" block, lines 2 to 3
